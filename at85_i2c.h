/**
 * Here SOFT_IIC just for a 6pins I2C/SPI ssd1306 device, It's pinout is "GND,VCC,SCL,SDA,DC,RST" , according to the
 * datasheet said, it's CS pin has already connected to GND. As you can see, they need a short pulse after power-up,
 * but the GPIO for Attiny85 is too expensive, So, here  according to the SSD1306 datasheet, create low level reset circuit
 * to generate a short pulse for reset pin.
 *
 * About the DC Pin. following from SSD1306 datasheet: 8.1.5.2 Write mode for I2C
 *
 *   1) The master device initiates the data communication by a start condition. The definition of the start
 * condition is shown in Figure 8-8. The start condition is established by pulling the SDA from HIGH to
 * LOW while the SCL stays HIGH.
 *
 *   2) The slave address is following the start condition for recognition use. For the SSD1306, the slave
 * address is either “b0111100” or “b0111101” by changing the SA0 to LOW or HIGH (D/C pin acts as SA0).
 *
 *   3) The write mode is established by setting the R/W# bit to logic “0”.
 *
 *   4) An acknowledgement signal will be generated after receiving one byte of data, including the slave
 * address and the R/W# bit. Please refer to the Figure 8-9 for the graphical representation of the
 * acknowledge signal. The acknowledge bit is defined as the SDA line is pulled down during the HIGH
 * period of the acknowledgement related clock pulse.
 *
 *   5) After the transmission of the slave address, either the control byte or the data byte may be sent across
 * the SDA. A control byte mainly consists of Co and D/C# bits following by six “0” ‘s.
 * a. If the Co bit is set as logic “0”, the transmission of the following information will co.......
 *
 * I guess at I2C mode, maybe DC pin can floating.
